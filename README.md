**Description: ** This project have been developed with the SOLID principles in mind. You can seen some design patterns like "The Observer pattern" sprinkled all over the code.

**Challanges**
- Even though my SOLID intensions are good, there is a lot of run to improvement. I am not satisfied with my UI solution, for instance.
- I found it hard to avoid MonoBehaviours, not so much happens in the background. I would love to hear some sugestions to kill this infestation.
- This project was a lot fun, so it is hard to let it go. It hurts me to think about the missing features (like Pfayer Lifes), or the features roughtly implemented (like the player respawn). 

**Decisions: ** This project is kind of an iceberg. The basic gameplay is there, but I tryed my best to make each one of the features as polished as possible. This decision forced me to rush a little towards the end, however I am very happy with the result.
